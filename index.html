                <h2>Missile Men of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan,</b> often referred to as the father of Pakistan's nuclear program, was a Pakistani scientist born in 1936. He played a pivotal role in the development of Pakistan's atomic bomb, making the country the world's seventh nuclear power. Khan's expertise in metallurgy and uranium enrichment propelled Pakistan into the nuclear age. Despite international controversy surrounding his involvement in nuclear proliferation, he remained a national hero in Pakistan, celebrated for his contributions to national security. Khan's legacy is a subject of debate, with some lauding him as a patriot and others criticizing his actions for potentially escalating global nuclear tensions. His later years were marked by controversy and house arrest, but his impact on Pakistan's nuclear capabilities remains undeniable, shaping the country's geopolitical landscape.</p>
